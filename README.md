### Possible improvements:

- *Gina:* Layout (see wireframes)

- *Gina:* Order of cities

- *Bradley:* Alignment... Choose one for paragraph, one for headings (not switching in the middle)

- *Qianya:* Proximity + whitespace: items are too close

- *Qianya:* Color scheme + contrast of text/background 

- *Bradley:* Readability and Legibility improvements

### Specific Issues:

- No offset/ font shadows
  - Creates a legibility issue that would be solved by getting rid of them.
-  Line length too long
  - Creates a readability issue
- Increase font size
  - Too small for the user to easily read. For a vacation website, we do not want the user to have to work to read the words. They should be as clear as possible to replicate the feel of being on vacation.
- Nav needs overhaul
  - Text has legibility issue
  - Buttons are small
  - They do not look like buttons
  - No telling what page the user is currently on
  - Hover function is on wrong element
- All header content is centered
  - This is an engagement issue as people get bored from everything being in the center (I was told this was called the pyramid design mistake). This is not the feeling we want for a adventurous website.
  - This also does not guide the user's eyes from top-left to bottom-right.
- All content is centered
  - Does not follow the users natural eye gravity from top-left to bottom-right.
- Fix any bugs or issues with HTML/CSS
  - Creating bullet proof websites

 

### New fonts:

- Abel (From Google Fonts): This font fits the theme/mood of the website as its very modern to reflect the digital aspect of the site. This geometric style font is visually pleasing while also being very direct with the information. This fits our site well as the user eyes are drawn towards it giving the sense of seeing something new while traveling.
- Roboto (From Google Fonts): To make sure the fonts fit well together, we will use the recommended font from google. Also this font provides the user with good legibility while reading large amounts of text.



### Other Notes:

We want to give this website a complete overhaul as it doesn't fit the theme we want to take it which is traveling in a digital world. The colors are very dark and should be updated to better reflect the upbeat and happy nature that is traveling. The layout is hard to read and should be changed. The text has both readability and legibility issues. We would also like to make the website look more appealing. Although it isn't a huge aspect in this course as of now, a bad looking website ruins the experience of traveling as we want the user to feel as if they are in a brand new world. So some minor changes with design will be made to fit this. Finally we will do any required parts of the assignment to make sure the project is as the customer asks.

As a general rule of thumb all of these changes will be worked on by all of us, however we will focus on the following...

​	Gina: As IA, she will be focusing on content and layout choices. 

​	Qianya: As VD, she will be focusing on usability and asthetics.

​	Bradley: As Tec., he will be focusing on HTML and CSS writing/formatting, bug fixing, and making it a bullet proof website.
